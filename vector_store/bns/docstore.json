Here, though B was not capable by law of\ncommitting an offence, A is liable to be punished in the same manner as if B had been capable\nby law of committing an offence, and had committed murder, and he is therefore subject to\nthe punishment of death.\n(c) A instigates B to set fire to a dwelling-house. B, in consequence of his mental\nillness, being incapable of knowing the nature of the act, or that he is doing what is wrong or\ncontrary to law, sets fire to the house in consequence of A\u2019s instigation.

(1) Whoever, intending to take dishonestly any movable property out of the\npossession of any person without that person\u2019s consent, moves that property in order to\nsuch taking, is said to commit theft.\nExplanation 1.\u2014A thing so long as it is attached to the earth, not being movable\nproperty, is not the subject of theft; but it becomes capable of being the subject of theft as\nsoon as it is severed from the earth.\nExplanation 2.\u2014A moving effected by the same act which effects the severance may\nbe a theft.\nExplanation 3.\u2014A person is said to cause a thing to move by removing an obstacle\nwhich prevented it from moving or by separating it from any other thing, as well as by\nactually moving it.\nExplanation 4.\u2014A person, who by any means causes an animal to move, is said to\nmove that animal, and to move everything which, in consequence of the motion so caused,\nis moved by that animal.\nExplanation 5.\u2014The consent mentioned in this sectionmay be express or implied, and\nmay be given either by the person in possession, or by any person having for that purpose\nauthority either express or implied.\nIllustrations.\n(a) A cuts down a tree on Z\u2019s ground, with the intention of dishonestly taking the tree\nout of Z\u2019s possession without Z\u2019s consent. Here, as soon as A has severed the tree in order\nto such taking, he has committed theft.\n(b) A puts a bait for dogs in his pocket, and thus induces Z\u2019s dog to follow it. Here, if\nA\u2019s intention be dishonestly to take the dog out of Z\u2019s possession without Z\u2019s consent, A\nhas committed theft as soon as Z\u2019s dog has begun to follow A.\n(c) A meets a bullock carrying a box of treasure. He drives the bullock in a certain\ndirection, in order that he may dishonestly take the treasure. As soon as the bullock begins\nto move, A has committed theft of the treasure.\n(d) A being Z\u2019s servant, and entrusted by Z with the care of Z\u2019s plate, dishonestly runs\naway with the plate, without Z\u2019s consent. A has committed theft.\n(e) Z, going on a journey, entrusts his plate to A, the keeper of a warehouse, till Z shall\nreturn. A carries the plate to a goldsmith and sells it. Here the plate was not in Z\u2019s possession.\nIt could not therefore be taken out of Z\u2019s possession, and A has not committed theft, though\nhe may have committed criminal breach of trust.\nTrespassing on\nburial places,\netc.\nUttering words,\netc., with\ndeliberate\nintent to\nwound religious\nfeelings.\nTheft.\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n45", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3575, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fb722ef5-3b38-43c3-836a-ee7b2d531e6f": {"__data__": {"id_": "fb722ef5-3b38-43c3-836a-ee7b2d531e6f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f5488d16-f6ff-4a0b-bd00-32baf0afb97f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "6d53ab8e94ea4ff4cef2d6cc7c89f9bc7406893bde85cef639f9c4f041cac2eb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "bf22bf3f-ae29-47da-9788-e45ddae9de0f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "daba907b3638faeb094940b34ba2a51e121defb2cb595d03ad02ec9f77eafce8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "37ab200f-7cf0-4482-a8b9-410a63eebe4f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "2aad8ec4465061a0dad659bb70b1fd94fe9bdf2c9c33e97830a70f72f26f0e98", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "060d0181d58c7c375d31b7e6ff32d3ec432beb231d83aa67f4c25c0d4c055d14", "text": "79\n(f) A finds a ring belonging to Z on a table in the house which Z occupies. Here the ring\nis in Z\u2019s possession, and if A dishonestly removes it, A commits theft.\n(g) A finds a ring lying on the highroad, not in the possession of any person. A, by\ntaking it, commits no theft, though he may commit criminal misappropriation of property.\n(h) A sees a ring belonging to Z lying on a table in Z\u2019s house. Not venturing to\nmisappropriate the ring immediately for fear of search and detection,  A hides the ring in a\nplace where it is highly improbable that it will ever be found by Z, with the intention of taking\nthe ring from the hiding place and selling it when the loss is forgotten. Here A, at the time of\nfirst moving the ring, commits theft.\n(i) A delivers his watch to Z, a jeweler, to be regulated. Z carries it to his shop. A, not\nowing to the jeweler any debt for which the jeweler might lawfully detain the watch as a\nsecurity, enters the shop openly, takes his watch by force out of Z\u2019s hand, and carries it away.\nHere A, though he may have committed criminal trespass and assault, has not committed\ntheft, inasmuch as what he did was not done dishonestly.\n(j) If A owes money to Z for repairing the watch, and if Z retains the watch lawfully as\na security for the debt, and A takes the watch out of Z\u2019s possession, with the intention of\ndepriving Z of the property as a security for his debt, he commits theft, inasmuch as he takes\nit dishonestly.\n(k) Again, if A, having pawned his watch to Z, takes it out of Z\u2019s possession without\nZ\u2019s consent, not having paid what he borrowed on the watch, he commits theft, though the\nwatch is his own property inasmuch as he takes it dishonestly.\n(l) A takes an article belonging to Z out of Z\u2019s possession without Z\u2019s consent, with\nthe intention of keeping it until he obtains money from Z as a reward for its restoration. Here\nA takes dishonestly; A has therefor committed theft.\n(m) A, being on friendly terms with Z, goes into Z\u2019s library in Z\u2019s absence, and takes\naway a book without Z\u2019s express consent for the purpose merely of reading it, and with the\nintention of returning it. Here, it is probable that A may have conceived that he had Z\u2019s\nimplied consent to use Z\u2019s book. If this was A\u2019s impression, A has not committed theft.\n(n) A asks charity from Z\u2019s wife. She gives A money, food and clothes, which A knows\nto belong to Z her husband. Here it is probable that A may conceive that Z\u2019s wife is authorised\nto give away alms. If this was A\u2019s impression, A has not committed theft.\n(o) A is the paramour of Z\u2019s wife.

The Commission suggested various enactments to the Government. One of the\nimportant recommendations made by the Commission was on, Indian Penal Code which was\nenacted in 1860 and the said Code is still continuing in the country with some amendments\nmade thereto from time to time.\n3. The Government of India considered it expedient and necessary to review the\nexisting criminal laws with an aim to strengthen law and order and also focus on simplifying\nlegal procedure so that ease of living is ensured to the common man. The Government also\nconsidered to make existing laws relevant to the contemporary situation and provide speedy\njustice to common man. Accordingly, various stakeholders were consulted keeping in mind\ncontemporary needs and aspirations of the people and with a view to create a legal structure\nwhich is citizen centric and to secure life and liberty of the citizens.\n4. Now, it is proposed to enact a new law, namely, the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita Bill,\n2023 by repealing the Indian Penal Code to streamline provisions relating to offences and\npenalties. It is proposed to provide first time community service as one of the punishments\nfor petty offences. The offences against women and children, murder and offences against\nthe State have been given precedence. The various offences have been made gender neutral.\nIn order to deal effectively with the problem of organised crimes and terrorist activities, new\noffences of terrorist acts and organised crime have been added in the Bill with deterrent\npunishments. A new offence on acts of secession, armed rebellion, subversive activities,\nseparatist activities or endangering sovereignty or unity and integrity of India has also been\nadded. The fines and punishment for various offences have also been suitably enhanced.\n5. The Notes on Clauses explains the various provisions of the Bill.\n6.
